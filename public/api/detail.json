It’s funny how pretending to do something that is against the law can be a form of </b><p>entertainment for us, when in some places, the secrets that spilled out of our mouths over portions of rum and gin would be more incriminating than the liquor we spilled into them.</p><p>That is what I wanted to say. But we had 15 minutes left before getting to my apartment and I was already on edge, so I bit my tongue. I had bristled at his first mention of religion and again when he verbally spit upon the man with a different faith, because those were warning signs, and because she was holding my hand through it all. I was terrified he might notice somehow, even though it was dark and there was no way his rearview mirror could capture the sight of our intertwined fingers resting between us on the seat.</p><p>But I have a different angle on his story. I am not a religious woman, but I will carry the story of that soldier offering condolences and feel a different kind of fire in my heart — one lit by the reverence I have for the beauty of humanity and how we all make sense of the world differently, even as we are still so similar.</p>"
